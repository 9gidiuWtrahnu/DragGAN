## How to Use Styles on Your PSR-3000 Keyboard
 
Styles are one of the most powerful features of your PSR-3000 keyboard. They allow you to create professional-sounding music with minimal effort. You can use styles to play along with your favorite songs, to compose your own songs, or to perform live for an audience. Styles are composed of several tracks, such as drums, bass, guitar, piano, strings, etc. Each track plays a musical pattern that matches the style name and the chord you play on the keyboard. For example, if you select a rock style and play a C chord, you will hear a rock rhythm with a C bass note, a C guitar chord, a C piano chord, and so on.
