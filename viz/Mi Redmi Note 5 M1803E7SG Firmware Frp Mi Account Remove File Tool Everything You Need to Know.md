## What is FRP and Mi Account Lock?
 
FRP stands for Factory Reset Protection and it is a security feature that prevents unauthorized access to your device after a factory reset. If you perform a factory reset on your device without logging out of your Google account, you will be asked to enter the same Google account and password that was previously synced with the device. This is to ensure that only you can use your device after a reset.
 
Mi account lock is similar to FRP but it applies to Xiaomi devices that have a Mi account. A Mi account is a cloud service that allows you to sync your data, files, settings, and preferences across Xiaomi devices. If you reset your device without logging out of your Mi account, you will be asked to enter the same Mi account and password that was previously synced with the device. This is to prevent unauthorized use of your device and data.
 
## How to Download and Use the Mi Account Unlock Tool?
 
The Mi Account Unlock Tool is a software that can bypass the FRP and Mi account verification on Xiaomi devices. It can also remove the pattern lock, PIN lock, or password lock from your device. To use this tool, you will need a Windows PC, a USB cable, and a Xiaomi device in EDL mode. EDL mode is a special mode that allows you to flash firmware or files on your device using a PC. To enter EDL mode, you will need to use a special boot cable or a test point on your device.
