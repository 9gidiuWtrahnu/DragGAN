Autopol Bend Simulator is a software that allows you to design, unfold and simulate bending operations for sheet metal parts. It is a modern 3D system that can import 2D DXF/DWG files and convert them into 3D models with accurate bend allowances. You can also create your own 3D models from scratch using the built-in CAD tools. Autopol Bend Simulator can help you optimize your press brake productivity and efficiency by enabling offline programming, bend sequence planning, collision detection, tool selection and more. In this article, we will show you how to use Autopol Bend Simulator to program press brakes for your sheet metal projects.

## Step 1: Import or Create a 3D Model
 
The first step is to import or create a 3D model of your sheet metal part in Autopol Bend Simulator. You can either use the File menu to open an existing 2D DXF/DWG file and convert it into a 3D model using the AutoPOL Unfolder[^1^], or you can use the CAD menu to draw your own 3D model using the AutoPOL Designer[^2^]. You can also edit your 3D model using the Modify menu, which offers various commands such as move, rotate, scale, mirror, copy, trim, extend, fillet and chamfer.
  
## Step 2: Define Material Properties and Tools
 
The next step is to define the material properties and tools for your sheet metal part. You can use the Material menu to select a predefined material from the database or create your own custom material with specific thickness, density, yield strength and bend allowance. You can also use the Tool menu to select a predefined tool set from the database or create your own custom tool set with specific punch and die profiles, lengths and angles. You can also use the Tool Library Manager[^3^] to manage your tool sets and assign them to different machines.
  
## Step 3: Plan Bend Sequence and Simulate Bending
 
The final step is to plan the bend sequence and simulate the bending process for your sheet metal part. You can use the Bend Sequence menu to automatically generate a bend sequence based on the geometry of your 3D model or manually modify it using the drag-and-drop interface. You can also use the Simulation menu to run a bending simulation that shows you how your sheet metal part will be bent on the press brake. You can check for any collisions, interferences or errors during the simulation and adjust your bend sequence or tools accordingly. You can also use the Report menu to generate a detailed report that includes information such as part name, material, tools, bend sequence, dimensions, angles and weights.
