You can choose your own gameplay approach, whether it is stealthy, aggressive, lethal, non-lethal, or a combination of them. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will affect how you interact with the game world and its characters.

## Stealthy
 
If you prefer to avoid direct confrontation and sneak past your enemies, you will need to invest in augmentations that enhance your stealth abilities, such as cloaking, silent movement, hacking, and radar. You will also need to use weapons and items that are silent and non-lethal, such as tranquilizer rifle, stun gun, gas grenades, and PEPS. You will also need to be aware of your surroundings and use cover, vents, ladders, and other environmental elements to hide and move around. Stealthy approach rewards you with more experience points for ghosting and smooth operator bonuses, as well as more opportunities to explore and find secrets.
 
## Aggressive
 
If you prefer to fight your way through your enemies and cause mayhem, you will need to invest in augmentations that enhance your combat abilities, such as dermal armor, recoil compensation, typhoon system, and aim stabilizer. You will also need to use weapons and items that are loud and lethal, such as combat rifle, shotgun, frag grenades, and rocket launcher. You will also need to be aware of your health and ammo levels and use cover, takedowns, and other combat tactics to survive. Aggressive approach rewards you with more loot from dead enemies and more fun from blowing things up.
 
## Lethal
 
If you prefer to kill your enemies rather than spare them, you will need to use weapons and items that cause fatal damage, such as pistols, sniper rifles, mines, and blades. You will also need to be aware of the consequences of your actions, as killing certain characters may affect the story or the availability of side missions. Lethal approach rewards you with more satisfaction from eliminating threats permanently.
 
## Non-Lethal
 
If you prefer to spare your enemies rather than kill them, you will need to use weapons and items that cause non-fatal damage, such as stun darts, tranquilizer darts, EMP grenades, and fists. You will also need to be aware of the state of your enemies, as knocking them out may not be enough if they are found by their allies or wake up after a while. Non-lethal approach rewards you with more respect from certain characters and the possibility of getting the pacifist achievement/trophy.
