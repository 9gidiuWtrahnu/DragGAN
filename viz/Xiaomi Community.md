## Step 1: Download yDGpatch
 
You can download yDGpatch from this link: [https://ydgpatch.software.informer.com/1.2/](https://ydgpatch.software.informer.com/1.2/). It is a small executable file that does not require installation. Just save it somewhere on your computer where you can easily access it.
 
## Step 2: Connect your TomTom device to your computer
 
Use a USB cable to connect your TomTom device to your computer. Make sure your device is turned on and recognized by your computer. You may need to install MyDrive Connect on your computer if you have not done so before. You can download it from this link: [https://www.tomtom.com/en\_gb/navigation/mydrive-connect/](https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/navigation/mydrive-connect/).
 
## Step 3: Run yDGpatch
 
Double-click on the yDGpatch.exe file that you downloaded in step 1. A small window will open with some options. Select your TomTom device from the drop-down menu at the top. Then, check the boxes for the patches that you want to apply. You can hover over each patch name to see a description of what it does. For example, you may want to check the "TTSystem" patch if you want to enable text-to-speech voices on your device.
 
When you are done selecting the patches, click on the "Patch" button at the bottom. A progress bar will show you how much time is left until the patching is complete. Do not disconnect your device or close the window until the process is finished.

## What is yDGpatch and how does it work?
 
yDGpatch is a tool that can patch any TomTom navcore (except for the newest models that are seen by the computer as network devices). It was created by yDdraigGoch, a member of the GPS Underground forum. yDGpatch works by modifying some files in the TTSystem folder of your device, which contains the core software of your TomTom. By patching these files, you can enable some features that are normally locked or restricted by TomTom, such as text-to-speech voices, custom speedcams, custom POIs, and more.
 
yDGpatch is very easy to use and does not require any technical skills. You just need to connect your device to your computer, run yDGpatch, select the patches that you want to apply, and click on the "Patch" button. yDGpatch will automatically backup your original files before patching them, so you can always restore them if something goes wrong. However, it is always recommended to make a full backup of your device before patching it, just in case.
 
## What are the benefits of patching your TomTom navcore?
 
Patching your TomTom navcore with yDGpatch can give you several benefits, such as:
 
- Updating your device with the latest maps and features without paying for a subscription or buying a new device.
- Using text-to-speech voices that can read out street names and other information on your device.
- Adding custom speedcams and POIs to your device that can warn you of speed limits and points of interest along your route.
- Changing the appearance and functionality of your device by installing custom skins and menus.
- Unlocking hidden features and settings on your device that are normally not accessible by the user.

Patching your TomTom navcore with yDGpatch can make your navigation experience more enjoyable and personalized. However, be aware that patching may also have some drawbacks, such as:

- Voiding your warranty or violating the terms of service of TomTom.
- Causing some errors or malfunctions on your device if the patches are not compatible with your navcore version or device model.
- Making your device vulnerable to viruses or malware if you download patches from untrusted sources.

Therefore, patching your TomTom navcore with yDGpatch is a decision that you should make carefully and responsibly. Always backup your device before patching it and only download patches from reliable sources.
