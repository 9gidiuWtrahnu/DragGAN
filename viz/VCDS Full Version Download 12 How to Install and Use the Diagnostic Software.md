## Step 1: Download the VCDS installer
 
The first step is to download the self-installing distribution file from the official website of Ross-Tech, the developer of VCDS. The current version of VCDS is 23.3, but if you want to use the older version 12, you can find it in some online sources, such as Google Drive[^2^] [^3^]. However, we recommend using the latest version for better compatibility and functionality.
 
To download the VCDS installer from Ross-Tech, go to [this link](https://www.ross-tech.com/vcds/download/current.php) and click on the "Download" button. You can also download a PDF file with installation instructions from the same page.
 
## Step 2: Install VCDS on your PC
 
The next step is to run the VCDS installer and follow the prompts to allow it to install itself on your PC. You must install VCDS on your PC's hard disk, not on other media. The installer will prompt you if you wish to see a PDF of installation instructions. You can also access that PDF from the link mentioned above.
 
VCDS works with Windows 7, 8, 10, and 11 (both 32-bit and 64-bit). Earlier versions of Windows such as 2000, XP, and Vista might still work, but they are not supported. VCDS does not work on Windows 10 or 11 running in "S mode", because "S mode" prevents software from being installed from any source other than the Microsoft Store. If you wish to use VCDS on a computer that came with the "S" version of Windows, you'll have to switch it to run in Home or Pro mode.
 
## Step 3: Connect an interface between your PC and your car
 
The final step is to connect an appropriate interface between your PC and your car. You can use any of the interfaces supported by VCDS, such as High-Tech HEX, KEY, KII or Micro-CAN series. You can buy these interfaces from Ross-Tech or from authorized distributors.
 
Once you have connected the interface, turn the car's ignition switch ON. No need to start the engine. Start the VCDS program and click [Options] and select the correct communications port. Use [Test] to confirm that the program can use the port and find the interface. Then [Save]. Now you can play with VCDS and access all the control modules that it supports in your car. You can also query fault codes, modify settings, perform tests, and more.
 
## Conclusion
 
VCDS is a powerful tool that allows you to diagnose and modify your Volkswagen Group vehicles. It works with various interfaces and Windows operating systems. To use it, you need to download and install it on your PC, connect an interface between your PC and your car, and start the program. You can find more information about VCDS on the official website of Ross-Tech or on their forums.
