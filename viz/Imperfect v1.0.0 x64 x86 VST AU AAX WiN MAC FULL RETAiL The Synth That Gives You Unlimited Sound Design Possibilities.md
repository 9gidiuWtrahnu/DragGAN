You can use the Wobble knob to introduce subtle or extreme variations in pitch and timing, creating a sense of movement and instability. You can use the Glitch button to randomly alter the synth parameters, generating unexpected and surprising results. You can use the FX Matrix to mix and match different effects, such as chorus, delay, reverb, phaser, and more.
 
Imperfect v1.0.0 also gives you full control over the modulation and expression of your sounds. You can use the LFOs and envelopes to modulate any parameter of the synth, creating dynamic and evolving sounds. You can also use the Mod Wheel, Pitch Bend, Aftertouch, and Velocity to add more expression and nuance to your performance.
