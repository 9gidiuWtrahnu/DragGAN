If you are a fan of Lupin III or anime in general, you might want to watch Lupin III: The First online. However, you should be careful about where you download or stream the film, as some sources might be illegal or unsafe. One way to find a reliable source is to use a torrent site that offers high-quality and verified files.

The film has a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10[^3^].

Some of the critics' highlights include:
 
- "Lupin III: The First is a sleek, loose, vibrant, and almost lifelike take on the character that is unbelievably entertaining from start to finish." - John Sooja, Common Sense Media[^4^]
- "Like Lupin himself, The First is a movie that looks slick as hell and knows it. Splashy visuals could hide a weak story, and while The First might not be the most narratively dense or complex tale thatâs been told with these characters, it packs the heart needed to propel its blockbuster visuals." - James Whitbrook, Gizmodo[^5^]
- "Lupin III: The First review â spectacular return for the legendary gentleman thief. Takashi Yamazakiâs version of the classic tale is visually arresting and boasts a cheeky, charming hero in a family-friendly CG animation." - Phuong Le, The Guardian[^2^]

Lupin III: The First is not only a successful adaptation of a beloved franchise, but also a showcase of the potential of CG animation in anime. It is a film that appeals to both old and new fans of Lupin III, and to anyone who enjoys a good adventure story with style and humor.
